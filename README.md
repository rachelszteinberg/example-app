# ExampleApp

This code was developed over a few days, to demonstrate some basic Angular UI coding. Both the code and unit tests are in a minimal state, meant to depict a basic working UI with routing. Ideally, the data would be coming from a service (typically handled as an Observable), but for this example it was hardcoded as mock data objects that are referenced directly in the components. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.

## Running Instructions
If this is the first time you are running the code, run `npm install` to download all dependencies. 

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Unit test results can be found in the coverage folder.
